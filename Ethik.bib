	title = {An Ethical Approach to Data Privacy Protection},
	volume = {6},
	abstract = {Privacy, trust and security are closely intertwined, as are law and ethics. Privacy preservation and security provisions rely on trust (e.g., one will allow only those whom one trusts to enter oneâ€™s zone of inaccessibility; one will not feel secure unless one trusts the security provider). Violation of privacy constitutes a risk, thus, a threat to security. Law provides a resolution when ethics cannot (e.g., ethics knows that stealing is wrong; the law punishes thieves); ethics can provide context to law (e.g., law allows trading for the purpose of making a profit, but ethics provides input into ensuring trade is conducted fairly). Privacy breaches disturb trust and run the risk of diluting or losing security; it is a show of disrespect to the law and a violation of ethical principles.},
