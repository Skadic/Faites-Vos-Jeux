	title = {An Ethical Approach to Data Privacy Protection},
	volume = {6},
	abstract = {Privacy, trust and security are closely intertwined, as are law and ethics. Privacy preservation and security provisions rely on trust (e.g., one will allow only those whom one trusts to enter one’s zone of inaccessibility; one will not feel secure unless one trusts the security provider). Violation of privacy constitutes a risk, thus, a threat to security. Law provides a resolution when ethics cannot (e.g., ethics knows that stealing is wrong; the law punishes thieves); ethics can provide context to law (e.g., law allows trading for the purpose of making a profit, but ethics provides input into ensuring trade is conducted fairly). Privacy breaches disturb trust and run the risk of diluting or losing security; it is a show of disrespect to the law and a violation of ethical principles.},

	url = {https://www.seagate.com/files/www-content/our-story/trends/files/idc-seagate-dataage-whitepaper.pdf},
	abstract = {This process of digitization is often referred to
as digital transformation, and it is profoundly
changing the shape of business today,
impacting companies in every industry and
consumers around the world. Digital
transformation is not about the evolution of
devices (though they will evolve), it is about
the integration of intelligent data into
everything that we do.
The data-driven world will be always on,
always tracking, always monitoring, always
listening, and always watching – because it will
be always learning. What we perceive to be
randomness will be bounded into patterns of
normality by sophisticated artificial intelligence
algorithms that will deliver the future in new
and personalized ways. Artificial intelligence
will drive even more automation into
businesses and feed processes and
engagements that will deliver new levels of
e ciency and products that are tailored to
business outcomes and individual customer
preferences.
Traditional paradigms will be redefined
(like vehicle or white goods ownership) and
ethical, moral and societal norms will be
challenged as genomics and advanced {DNA}
profiling influence healthcare directives,
insurance premiums, and spousal choices.
Entertainment will literally be transformed
before our eyes as virtual reality technologies
transport us into new digital realities and
augmented reality will dramatically change
the service industry as we know it today},
